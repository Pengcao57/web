# Abstract

EZGas is a crowdsourcing service that allows users to:
* collect prices of fuels in different gas stations
* locate gas stations in an area, along with the prices they practice.

EZGas is supported by a web application (accessible both via smartphone or PC)

# Stakeholders


| Stakeholder name  | Description | 
| ----------------- |:-----------:|
| Developer | Develops the application and checks periodically for possible raising issues. |
| Administrator | Works closely with the application development teams to tune and troubleshoot the application. Leads and participates in efforts to implement application updates to include upgrades, patches, and new releases with the goal of meeting the end users' needs. He is fully responsible for daily monitoring and maintanance activities (monitors and if neccessary can ban users, stop hackers, fix accounts). | 
| User | Uses the application directly, because he is interesting in finding the closest gas stations (or the most convenient one) and in keeping prices up to date. |
| GoogleMaps | Provides an Application Program Interface (API) to the application, so that gas stations can be easily localized. |

# Stories and personas

Alice, Susan and Ally are a group of friends that love to travel by car. Since they visit new places, one of the challenges they face during their trips is finding gas stations to refill their car when they are running low on fuel. They've often had to ask the local people for information for the nearest gas stations. They would like to have a simpler way of locating gas stations with respect to their position.

Larry is a truck driver.
Everyday he travels long distances through areas that most of the time he is not familiar with. It would be very useful for him to know where gas stations near him are located when he needs to refill, especially the most convenient one.

Abigail has always believed that knowledge is power.
Thatâ€™s why when she sees an offer, she thinks everyone should know about it. She works an hour from home and knows first-hand how expensive fuel can be as she relies on her car to get her there. For this reason, when she comes across a gas station with good fuel prices, she would love to be able to share this information with whoever could benefit from it.

Sara is a nature lover. In order to avoid polluting, she has bought an electric car.
However it can be difficult for her to find gas stations that allow her to charge the battery. She recently found one, and noted it down to share this information with those friends of hers which also have an electric car. 
Sara would like to have a simple way of locating the nearest gas stations that recharges electrical cars, and share this information with others.

John is the administrator of EzGas. Aside from working on application updates and fixing possible bugs, he is responsible for the daily monitoring of users. A certain user has been misusing the application, giving only negative feedback to prices and inserting prices that are never reported by other users who have gone to the same stations. In cases like these, it is John's job to warn the user that he will be banned if the incorrect behaviour continues.

|  4 	 | The search process starts |
|  5	 | EZGas provides a list of gas stations based only on the GPS position, using a default value (e.g. 5 km) as maximum distance of gas stations from the User's position. |


### Use case 7, UC7 - FR3.1  Positive feedback: the price is correct 

| Actors Involved        | User |

|  Nominal Scenario     | User U selects price P of the fuel type F of the gas station he is at, selects "give negative feedback", then U inserts correct price of F, and quantity of negative feedbacks is incremented for (P,F). |
|  Variants     | User U inputs invalid price (negative price or invalid format), issue warning. |

##### Scenario 8.1

| Scenario ID: SC8.1        | Corresponds to UC8  |

|  Post condition     | Number of reports for the specific gas station incremented by one |
|  Nominal Scenario     | User U sends a request for reporting a gas station that hasn't been inserted yet in EZGas. The request will remain pending until it reaches a certain quantity N of reports from different users. |
|  Variants     | If the request is the Nth one related to that specific gas station, this will be added among the available ones. |

##### Scenario 10.1

|  1     | User U inserts required information about a certain gas station|
|  2     | User U confirms and sends the request |
|   	 | (The request will remain pending until that gas station receives at least N reports by different users.) |
